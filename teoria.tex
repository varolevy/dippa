In this chapter error sources are introduced because before we can start
testing errors in video we must understand where are the
erros generated.That will also help genereting test methods but also
understanding results and actions followed by them. 

I have diveded erros in the algroritmic and hardware based
errors. Main focus will be on the algorithmic errors, but essential errors
like noise is mostly based on hardware so those will be also introduced. Some
errors have overlapping reasons like in example jitter might be caused by
poor processor performance or designs errors in architechture.

-Colour noise

\subsection{Blink}
-Exposure jumping
-
\subsection{Motion smoothness}
