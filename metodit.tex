\section{State of art in Video testing}

Most widely used methods are PSNR and MSE ~\cite{4347144}
Benefits
*Easy to calculate, easy to compare
Minuses
*Correlation with visible erros low sometimes
\subsection{Reference testing}

\subsection{Non-Reference testing}

Model where watermark is added to video and the idea is that after the video
os gone trough the modification pipeline(algorithms, compressions etc) that
once the watermark is extracted from result video the degeneration is about
the same that it would be for the actual video. ~\cite{1203346}

*Spatial response
*Temporal response
