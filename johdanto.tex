Every second there are xx minutes of video uploaded just to Youtube.com. Most
of there videos are taken with mobile devices. 

Analysis, subjective or objective, for video is just starting. In year xx
there where xx articles in IEEE explorer but after two year the amount of
arcticles has skyrockete and there is no end. 

The goal for this thesis is to make state of art analysis of current methods
of video testing. I will not study transmission erros over networks. I focus 
on erros coming from coding, device, optics,
ois(optical image stabilization), etc. I try to focus more on non-reference
methods but reference video methods are also studied and introduced. 

Video quality can be determined with psychophysical experiments, but they are
expensive and time consuming to arrange. There are no physical measure like
meter to predict the quality of video. 

On first chapter I will introduce what is mobile device and the restrcitions
of it. Dirrerent error types and their causes are introduced.

Second chapter digs in to the differnet testing methods: 
subjective, objective, reference, non-reference, black box and etc. 

Third chapter shows comparision of different methods or practical example
done with matlab. This is under evalution. 

Fourth chapter is for conclusions.
